## Description

Precomfpricing is a Python library designed for analyzing and visualizing pricing related to inclusion preconfirmations in blockchain transactions. It provides tools for data analysis, model fitting, and visualization of gas usage and rewards.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Merging**: Load transaction and builder data from CSV files, merge them on `block_number`, and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Logarithmic Model**: Fit a logarithmic model to cumulative gas and rewards data, calculate model parameters, and visualize the fit.
- **Autocorrelation Validation**: Validate autocorrelation using ACF and PACF plots, perform stationarity tests, and fit ARIMA models.
- **Pricing and Rewards Visualization**: Visualize pricing surfaces and compare model-based proposer rewards with constant inclusion tips.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Conduct spectral analysis on detrended data to identify frequency components.

## Installation

First, decompress the data files in Data.

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed. You can install the required dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

To run the main analysis and visualization, execute the following command:

```bash
python InclusionPricing.py
```

This will load the data, perform the analysis, and generate the visualizations.

## Dependencies

- `numpy` ^2.2.0
- `matplotlib` ^3.10.0
- `pandas` ^2.2.3
- `scipy` ^1.14.1
- `statsmodels` ^0.14.4
